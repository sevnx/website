## Presentation

La Forge Solidaire is a neighborhood tool-sharing web application developed as part of my university coursework. The platform allows users to list their tools for lending, browse available tools from neighbors, and manage borrow requests through a request-approval workflow. The project follows a client-server architecture with a React front-end, a Spring Boot REST API, and a MySQL database, all orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Key responsibilities

- Built the entire **React SPA** with **TypeScript**, using **TanStack Router** (file-based routing) and **TanStack Query** for server state management
- Implemented **cookie-based JWT authentication** flow with context providers, route guards, and automatic session expiration handling via Axios interceptors
- Designed the tool browsing interface with search, availability status indicators, and a **calendar-based borrow request** system
- Created tool management views allowing owners to list tools with **drag-and-drop image upload** and accept/refuse incoming borrow requests
- Used **shadcn/ui** components with **Tailwind CSS** for a consistent, responsive UI
- Set up **type-safe error handling** across all API calls using `neverthrow` (`ResultAsync`) and **ArkType** for form validation schemas
